# algorithms
Java based Implementation of Algorithms and Data Structure. Helpful for Interviews if you are preparing. I have tested all of the programs
in my local machine but it might contains bugs, errors or might not have done well with corner and edge cases so please feel free to extend.

If you want to do let me know about some bugs/errors or alternative solution feel free to fire an email at : khatri.bijay@gmail.com
